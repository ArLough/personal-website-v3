# About

You can find this website deployed at https://www.aidanloughney.me/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Main goals of building this site were to strengthen my skills in React.js while also trying out Next.js and Tailwind CSS!

## Getting Started
